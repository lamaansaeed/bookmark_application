This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

#PROBLEMS I FACED DURING THE MAKING OF THIS APPLICATION
Time : as work load at my office is kind of heavy from few days 
Tech stack : the tech stack was new for me honestly but  once i start digging it i realized that its just eazy peezy and i have done more complex project previously so the experince came handy .
THE Mysterious Problem : after placing all the pieces of the puzzel at the prefect place , i was getting the realtime websocket error , so normally we create our own web socket but here supabase is providing that , and i realized that my data is not reflecting on the screen at real time , and then i start debugging it for hours and hours and hours and then eventually called out a senior develper for assistance and we sat for couple of hours with no success ,but then i decided to deploy it on vercel and  i did deployed it .to my surprise it worked on vercel without any error and my project was finally realtime .
